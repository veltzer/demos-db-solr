The purpose of this exercise is to understand the "stored" property of fields.

On a clean core (remove existing data if you need to) create the following schema:
	name: text_en (indexed, stored, uninvertible)
	year: pint (indexed, stored, uninvertible)
	description: text_en (indexed, stored, uninvertible)

The data in the attached "films.csv" file.

Query all the data and also query with "name:Rings"
See that everything is ok

Now remove the name field and re-create it without the "stored" value.

Query all the data and also query with "name:Rings"
What is missing from the results?

What does it mean?
