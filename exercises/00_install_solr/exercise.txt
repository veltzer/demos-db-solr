Install solr in two ways: via docker and via a binary package

Before doing the following exercise make sure you don't already have solr running
on you system (check port 8983)

Via docker
==========
These instructions are for ubuntu systems, other system may need adjustments...
- run docker on your system
	$ sudo systemctl start docker.socket
	$ sudo systemctl start docker.service
	$ sudo systemctl start containerd.service
- run a container with the latest version of solr and connect it to your network:
	$ docker run --detach=true --name=solr --network host solr:latest
	This will pull the latest version of solr from 'https://hub.docker.com'
	and will run a container with that latest version.
	It will also connect the network of the new container
- see your container running via:
	$ docker container ls
- browse your solr via:
	http://localhost:8983
- turn off the container with:
	$ docker stop solr
	$ docker rm solr
- stop docker with:
	$ sudo systemctl stop docker.socket
	$ sudo systemctl stop docker.service
	$ sudo systemctl stop containerd.service

Via a binary package:
=====================
These instructions are for a linux system, windows systems may need some adjustments
from https://solr.apache.org/guide/8_0/installing-solr.html
Make sure you have java installed since the solr package does not contain a java runtime
environment, e.g.:
	$ java -version
	openjdk version "11.0.11" 2021-04-20
	OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.11+9-Ubuntu-0ubuntu2)
	OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.11+9-Ubuntu-0ubuntu2, mixed mode, sharing)
- download the right package from https://solr.apache.org/downloads.html
- unpack the package to a folder of your choosing, e.g.:
	$ tar xvf solr-8.10.1.tgz
- run solr:
	$ cd solr-8.10.1
	$ bin/solr start
- browse your solr via:
	http://localhost:8983
- turn off your solr via:
	$ bin/solr stop
