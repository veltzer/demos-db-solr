Install solr in several ways:

Via docker
These instructions are for ubuntu systems, other system may need adjustments...
- run docker on your system
	$ sudo systemctl start docker.socket
	$ sudo systemctl start docker.service
	$ sudo systemctl start containerd.service
- run a container with the latest version of solr and connect it to your network:
	$ docker run --detach=true --name=solr --network host solr:latest
	This will pull the latest version of solr from 'https://hub.docker.com'
	and will run a container with that latest version.
	It will also connect the network of the new container
- see your container running via:
	$ docker container ls
- browse your solr via:
	http://localhost:8983
- turn off the container with:
	$ docker stop solr
	$ docker rm solr
- stop docker with:
	$ sudo systemctl stop docker.socket
	$ sudo systemctl stop docker.service
	$ sudo systemctl stop containerd.service
