The idea of this exercise is to manipulate the schmea from the command line.

- see you schema via:
	$ curl "http://localhost:8983/solr/my_core/schema"
	and
	$ curl "http://localhost:8983/solr/my_core/schema/fields"

- add a field:
	$ curl -X POST -H 'Content-type:application/json' --data-binary '{"add-field":{"name":"anotherfield","type":"text_en","stored":true,"indexed":true }}' http://localhost:8983/solr/my_core/schema

- check that the field was really added:
	$ curl "http://localhost:8983/solr/my_core/schema/fields"

- delete the field:
	$ curl -X POST -H 'Content-type:application/json' --data-binary '{"delete-field" : { "name":"anotherfield" }}' http://localhost:8983/solr/my_core/schema
