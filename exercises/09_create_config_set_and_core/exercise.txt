In this exercise we will create config set and a core/collection using it.

First make sure that Solr is running in cloud mode. In cloud mode you can query zookeeper properties
like this:

$ curl "http://localhost:8983/solr/zookeeper?detail=true&path=%2Fclusterstate.json"

So if this query fails you are not in cloud mode.

To run solr in cloud mode use:

$ $SOLR_HOME/bin/solr start -cloud

First lets create a core from the command line:

$ $SOLR_HOME/bin/solr create_core -c foo

Did you see the warning? This is because you are using the _default configuration for the core that comes
with the solr distribution.

That configuration is really located at:
	$SOLR_HOME/server/solr/configsets/_default

Take a moment to explore this config

Delete the core you created with:

$ $SOLR_HOME/bin/solr delete -c foo

Now lets create our own config. We will copy an existing config:

$ (cd $SOLR_HOME/server/solr/configsets/sample_techproducts_configs/conf && zip -r - *) > myconfigset.zip

* If you are on windows and the above command does not run you can use the pre-prepared myconfigset.zip
that is in this exercises folder.

Use the following command to upload the new configuration:

$ curl -X POST --header "Content-Type:application/octet-stream" --data-binary @myconfigset.zip "http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/configs?action=UPLOAD&name=myConfigSet"
