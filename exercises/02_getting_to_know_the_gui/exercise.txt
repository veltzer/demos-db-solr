Everything is via the web

1. Create a collection called "films".
2. Create fields in the collection.
	id: str (this is actually built-in).
		You don't have to add this.
	You only have to add these three fields:
	name: str
	year: most suitable date type
	description: str
3. Add one movie manually (GUI) to the collection.
4. Query the collection via the GUI.
