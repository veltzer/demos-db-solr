- Use the "films.csv" file with information about a few films.
- Import the file via the command line into the "my_core"
	collection.
	Use "curl" to do it.
	Find out on your own how to do that (don't peek at the solution).
- Execute a query from the command line and see the data that
	you imported in the previous stage.
	Use "curl" to do it.
	Find out on your own how to do that (don't peek at the solution).
- Delete all documents from your core.
	Use "curl" to do it.
	Find out on your own how to do that (don't peek at the solution).

Repeat the same with XML format instead of CSV.
You will have to create a films.xml version of the films.csv file
and import it as XML.
