Use a core you have and define a schema via the console

- Use the core that you have and the "Schema" section of the console to define the
following schema:
	id: str (this is actually built-in).
		You don't have to add this.
	You only have to add these three fields:
	name: string
	year: pint
	description: string
	* accept all defaults when creating the fields
- see the properties of your fields from the "Schema" panel by selecting each field.
- add one movie manually to the collection using the "Documents" panel.
	Here is the data:
==============================
name,year,description
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,2001,Best movie ever
==============================
	Make sure you get success for your import.
- query the collection via the console using the "Query" panel.
	See that your data is in.
	See that your fields got the right values.
	Who added the id? We didn't.
- now delete your document from the console
	Go to "Documents"
	select "/update" as handler
	select "XML" as document type.
	type in the following document:
		<delete><query>*:*</query></delete>
	and submit
- see that your document was really deleted from the "Query" panel.

Notes:
You could delete with JSON format by selecting "JSON" as the document type and the following
content:
	{'delete': {'query': '*:*'}}
