first read the following:
======================================
Core

In Solr, a core is composed of a set of configuration files, Lucene index files, and Solrâ€™s transaction log.

a Solr core is a uniquely named, managed, and configured index running in a Solr server; a Solr server can host one or more cores. A core is typically used to separate documents that have different schemas

collection

Solr also uses the term collection, which only has meaning in the context of a Solr cluster in which a single index is distributed across multiple servers.

SolrCloud introduces the concept of a collection, which extends the concept of a uniquely named, managed, and configured index to one that is split into shards and distributed across multiple servers.
======================================

- when solr is running create a new core of your choosing:
	$ bin/solr create_core -c my_core
- to to the admin console and see your new core under "Core Admin"
- locate and browser the folders that were created with the "create_core" command
	under your solr installation:
	"$SOLR_ROOT/server/solr/my_core"
- create another core called "my_core2" via the solr admin console.
	First create a folder for you second core and its data:
	$ mkdir "$SOLR_ROOT/server/solr/my_core2" "$SOLR_ROOT/server/solr/my_core2/data"
	You will have to copy the "conf" subfolder of the first core you create to the second core folder
	$ cp -r "$SOLR_ROOT/server/solr/my_core/conf" "$SOLR_ROOT/server/solr/my_core2/conf"
	Use the "Add Core" button from the console to add the new core
