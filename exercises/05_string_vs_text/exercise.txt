The purpose of this exercise is to understand the difference between
type "string" to type "text_*"

- check that the field 'name' is of type 'string'

- query on part of the name
	name:Rings

- now change the name to "text_en"
	This type of change requies reindexing so delete all documents and reimport.

- Now issue the partial query again.
	name:Rings

- What did we learn?
