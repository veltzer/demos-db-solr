The purpose of this exercise is to understand the difference between
type "string" to type "text_*"

- check that the field 'name' is of type 'string'
	and that you have the data int

- query on part of the name, e.g.:
	name:Rings

- now change the 'name' fields type to "text_en"
	This type of change requies reindexing so delete all documents and reimport.
	Make sure the field is indexed.

- Now issue the partial query again.
	name:Rings

- What did we learn?

- now change the field 'name' to be non-indexed.

- Now issue the partial query again.
	name:Rings

- What did we learn?
