The purpose of this exercise is to learn about the "indexed" attribute of fields.

- Search for a film that you have the name for:
	Do that via the solr web console under the "Query" panel.
	In the query put:
	name:7

- Change the 'name' field to of type "text_en" and non indexed.
	Do that via the solr web console under the "Schema" panel.
	Delete the field.
	Define it again but without the "indexed" attribute (you will need to set "uninvertible" to false to).
	Set the type to "text_en"

- Query for "name:7" again.

- What did you learn?
