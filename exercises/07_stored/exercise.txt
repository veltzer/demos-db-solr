The purpose of this exercise is to understand the "stored" property of fields.

On a clean core (newly created) create the following schema:
	name: text_en (indexed, stored, uninvertible)
	year: pint (indexed, stored, uninvertible)
	description: text_en (indexed, stored, uninvertible)

Import the data in the attached "films.csv" file.

Query all the data and also query with "name:Rings"
See that everything is ok

Now do the same experiment with the only difference being that the 'name'
field with have "stored=false"

Query all the data and also query with "name:Rings"
What is missing from the results?

What does it mean?
